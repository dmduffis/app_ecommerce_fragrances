## 01. Define
The identification of pain points revealed a significant absence: a lack of a culturally sensitive eCommerce self-care application for Latina women. This demographic faced challenges in finding a platform that resonated with their cultural identity and provided a personalized shopping experience. Consequently, the project requirements emphasized the development of a visually appealing app tailored to recognize the diverse cultural nuances prevalent within Caribbean Latin America. The choice of a cross-platform app acknowledges the use of Android as the primary platform in the region.

## 02. Design
Visual representation focused on using images resonant with Latina women and incorporating elements reflecting the warmth and vibrancy of Caribbean culture. Spanish served as the primary language for navigation. The color scheme evoked the essence of the Caribbean, with vibrant hues and warm tones. Cultural elements specific to the Caribbean, like local patterns and symbols, were integrated into the design.

## 03. Deliver
The technology stack included React Native for cross-platform development, ensuring compatibility with both Android and iOS. Stripe was integrated for secure payment processing, while WhatsApp integration facilitated communication, aligning with its widespread usage in Latin America for personal and business purposes.
